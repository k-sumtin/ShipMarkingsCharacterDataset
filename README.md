# ShipMarkingsCharacterDataset
A publicly available repository of diverse ship characters and digits datasets curated to enhance character recognition in maritime applications.
This repository hosts a variation of original digits and characters extracted from ship bodies, as well as augmented datasets generated using the powerful WGAN-GP and WGAN-DIV models.

Dataset Details:
Original Content: Imprinted characters and digits from ship markings
Augmented Datasets: Synthetic images created by WGAN-GP and WGNA-DIV
Formats: Images (PNG/JPG)
Purpose: Advancing character recognition and data augmentation techniques in maritime applications
